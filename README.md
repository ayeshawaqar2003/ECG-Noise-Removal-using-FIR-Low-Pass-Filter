# ECG Signal Denoising using FIR Low-Pass Filter

This MATLAB project demonstrates the use of a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) low-pass filter** to remove high-frequency noise from an assumed electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The filter is designed using the **Hanning window method** and applied to a synthetic ECG signal composed of sinusoidal components and Gaussian noise.

## ðŸ”¬ Signal Generation

A synthetic ECG-like signal is generated as follows:
```matlab
ecg_signal = 0.7*sin(2*pi*10*t) + 0.5*sin(2*pi*30*t) + randn(size(t));

This signal simulates clean ECG components with added high-frequency noise.

# How the Filter Works
Compute normalized frequency bounds.

Define an ideal rectangular response.

Apply Hanning window to reduce spectral leakage.

Normalize the filter coefficients.

Filter the ECG signal using filter().
